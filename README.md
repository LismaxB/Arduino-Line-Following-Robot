# Line Following Robot using Arduino

## Introduction
A line following robot is an autonomous robot that uses sensors and programming to follow a line or track. This project provides a comprehensive guide on how to build a simple line following robot using an Arduino microcontroller board.

## Components Required
To build the line following robot, gather the following components:

- Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller board
- Geared DC motors x2
- Motor driver module (such as L293D)
- Infrared (IR) sensors x2
- Chassis or platform to mount the robot
- Wheels and casters
- Battery pack or power supply
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard or soldering equipment (optional, for circuit connections)

## Circuit Connections
Follow these steps to connect the components:

1. Connect the power supply or battery pack to the Arduino board.
2. Connect the motor driver module to the Arduino. Attach the input pins (e.g., IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4) of the motor driver to the appropriate Arduino digital pins.
3. Connect the geared DC motors to the motor driver outputs (e.g., OUT1, OUT2, OUT3, OUT4).
4. Connect the IR line tracking sensors to the Arduino analog pins. Ensure the sensors are properly aligned with the surface on which the robot will move.
5. Ensure all ground (GND) connections are connected together.

## Software Setup
To program the line following robot, complete the following steps:

1. Install the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) on your computer if you haven't already.
2. Connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
4. Write the necessary code to control the line following robot. The code should include logic to read sensor values, make decisions based on the line position, and control the motors accordingly.
5. Upload the code to the Arduino board.

## Programming Logic
Here's an example of the programming logic for a line following robot:

1. Define the pin numbers for the sensor inputs and motor outputs.
2. In the setup() function, initialize the sensor pins as inputs and the motor pins as outputs.
3. In the loop() function, read the sensor values using analogRead().
4. Determine the position of the line (left, center, or right) based on the sensor values.
5. Use if-else statements or a switch-case construct to make decisions based on the line position.
6. For instance, if the line is detected on the left, slow down or reverse the left motor while keeping the right motor running forward. If the line is detected in the center, keep both motors running at the same speed. Adjust the motor speeds accordingly for the right line position.
7. Repeat the loop continuously to track and follow the line.

## Testing and Calibration
Once the code is uploaded and the connections are in place, perform the following steps to test and calibrate the line following robot:

1. Place the robot on a surface with a visible line.
2. Ensure the sensors are positioned correctly to detect the line.
3. Power on the robot and observe its behavior.
4. Make adjustments to the code or sensor positions as necessary to improve line following accuracy.
5. Fine-tune the threshold values or adjust the motor speeds to achieve better performance.
6. Iterate the testing and calibration process until the robot follows the line accurately.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully built a simple line following robot using Arduino. This project provides a comprehensive guide to help you through the process of building and programming the robot. Enjoy exploring the exciting world of robotics with your line following robot
