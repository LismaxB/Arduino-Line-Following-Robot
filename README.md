# Line Following Robot using Arduino

## Introduction
A line following robot is a simple autonomous robot that follows a line or track using sensors and programming logic. This project provides a comprehensive guide on how to build a basic line following robot using an Arduino microcontroller board.

## Components Required
- Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller board
- Geared DC motors x2
- Motor driver module (such as L293D)
- Infrared (IR) sensors x2
- Chassis or platform to mount the robot
- Wheels and casters
- Battery pack or power supply
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard or soldering equipment (optional, for circuit connections)

## Circuit Connections
Follow the circuit connection instructions in the [Circuit Connections](#circuit-connections) section of the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) file.

## Software Setup
Refer to the [Software Setup](#software-setup) section of the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) file for instructions on setting up the Arduino IDE and uploading the code to the Arduino board.

## Programming Logic
The programming logic and code for the line following robot can be found in the [Programming Logic](#programming-logic) section of the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) file.

## Testing and Calibration
To test and calibrate the line following robot, follow the instructions outlined in the [Testing and Calibration](#testing-and-calibration) section of the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md) file.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully built a simple line following robot using Arduino. This project serves as a foundation for more advanced robotics projects. For more details and the complete documentation, refer to the [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) file.
